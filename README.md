# regex

This ( is | ( will be )) a repository of various useful PCRE, Javascript, PHP, and possibly other regular expression patterns. I usually create my own regex so if the same pattern is found somewhere else, it is most likely a coincidence and not a case of me borrowing from someone else. If a case arrises where I do take someone elses work, I will definitely anotate the code with a reference.
